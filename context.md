# Privacy-Preserving Fall Risk Detection System

## Project Overview
Build a computer vision system that detects high-risk movements and potential falls while preserving privacy through pose estimation (skeleton tracking).

## Why This Project is Perfect for Inspiren:
- **Privacy-first**: Uses pose estimation (skeleton) instead of identifying features
- **Real-time processing**: Demonstrates streaming video analysis
- **Healthcare-focused**: Fall detection for elderly care
- **Model investigation**: Includes performance analysis and failure case investigation
- **Production-ready**: Shows deployment considerations

- **Perfect because**: Designed specifically for fall detection research

### 2. Backup Dataset: NTU RGB+D Action Recognition
- **Source**: Available on various academic platforms
- **Content**: Human actions including falls, sitting, standing
- **Use for**: Training action classification models

### 3. Synthetic Option: Generate with MediaPipe
- **Source**: Use MediaPipe to extract pose keypoints from any video

    """
    Convert video frame to anonymous pose keypoints
    - No facial recognition
    - No identifying features stored
    - Only movement patterns analyzed
    """
```

### 2. Healthcare-Specific Metrics
```python
def evaluate_healthcare_model(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Healthcare-focused evaluation:
    - Prioritize sensitivity (don't miss real falls)
    - Analyze alert fatigue potential
    - Cost-benefit analysis of false positives
    """
```

### 3. Model Investigation Framework
```python
def investigate_model_failures(failed_cases):
    """
    Systematic approach to understanding CV failures:
    - Pattern analysis in misclassifications
    - Environmental factor correlation

    """
```

### 4. Real-time Performance Monitoring
```python
def monitor_realtime_performance():
    """
    Production monitoring simulation:
    - Latency tracking (must be under 90 seconds)
    - Accuracy drift detection
    - Alert volume optimization
    """
```

## Time Investment: 8-10 hours total
- Can be built over a weekend
- Each phase produces demonstrable results
- Directly addresses Inspiren's needs

## Key Talking Points for Interview:

### 1. Privacy-First Design
"I built this system using pose estimation to create skeleton views, just like your AUGi system. This preserves resident privacy while enabling effective monitoring."

### 2. Model Investigation Experience
"When my fall detection model had false positives during low-light conditions, I systematically investigated the failure patterns and developed lighting-robust features - exactly the kind of CV model investigation you need."

### 3. Healthcare-Specific Considerations
"I optimized for sensitivity over specificity because missing a real fall is much worse than a false alarm in healthcare settings. I analyzed the tradeoff between alert fatigue and patient safety."

### 4. Real-time Processing
"The system processes video frames in real-time and can trigger alerts within seconds, similar to your 90-second response time requirement."
