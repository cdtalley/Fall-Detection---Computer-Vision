# Privacy-Preserving Fall Risk Detection System

A computer vision system that detects high-risk movements and potential falls while preserving privacy through pose estimation (skeleton tracking). This project demonstrates capabilities in building and maintaining production-ready computer vision systems for healthcare applications.

## üéØ Why This Project is Perfect for Inspiren

This system mirrors the privacy-first approach of AUGi, using pose estimation to create anonymous skeleton views while enabling effective monitoring. It demonstrates:

- **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**: Uses MediaPipe pose estimation to convert video to anonymous keypoints
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video streams with sub-second latency
- **Healthcare-Focused ML**: Optimized for sensitivity over specificity to prevent missed falls
- **Model Investigation Framework**: Systematic analysis of failure cases and performance degradation
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Complete monitoring dashboard and alert system
